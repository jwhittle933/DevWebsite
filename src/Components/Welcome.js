        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>I'm a self-taught, programming polyglot who stumbled and bumbled into a love for web development. Currently, I'm a React developer for <a href="https://www.eltoro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">El Toro</a> and a doctoral student at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, studying the Septuagint of Proverbs. My desire is to blend my two loves: web development and Ancient Near Eastern Languages, an ecclectic mix of ancient and modern. </p>
        <p>Although I use React during the day, I also enjoy Vue and Laravel, Go, ASP.NET, and Python. </p>
